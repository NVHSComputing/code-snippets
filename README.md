# Code Snippets
These are some helpful code snippets for NVHS's computing team.

All code snippets are in Java (as that's what the majority of the team uses.)

The `advanced` folder contains more advanced items. Make sure you completely understand the
fundamentals of Java and the rest of the code snippets before advancing to the `advanced` folder.
Otherwise, you will probably not understand most of the snippets there. (Don't feel bad if you can't
understand those; most of them are not required, just helpful shorthand for basic operations.)

## Snippet Types
There are a couple snippet types contained in this repository. So far we have:
### Regular
- Input/Output
- Array Manipulation
- ArrayList Manipulation

### Advanced
- Ternary operators and lambdas
- Streams API
- Search Algorithms
- Comparators
